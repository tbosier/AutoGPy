Method	Time Complexity	Matrix Type	Pros	Cons
Cholesky	O(n3/3)O(n3/3)	Symmetric, positive definite	Fast for small-to-medium problems	Limited to SPD matrices
LU Decomposition	O(2n3/3)O(2n3/3)	General square matrices	General-purpose	Slower than Cholesky
QR Decomposition	O(2n3)O(2n3)	General matrices	Handles rectangular matrices	Slowest among direct solvers
Conjugate Gradient (CG)	O(kn2)O(kn2)	Symmetric, positive definite	Fast for large sparse matrices	Iterative, may not converge
GMRES	O(kn2)O(kn2)	Non-symmetric, general matrices	Handles non-symmetric matrices	Iterative, may not converge
BiCGSTAB	O(kn2)O(kn2)	Non-symmetric, general matrices	Better convergence for some problems	Iterative, may be slower
Multigrid Methods	O(n)O(n)	Large, structured sparse matrices	Very fast for structured problems	Complex to implement
